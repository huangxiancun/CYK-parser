## NLP作业：句法分析器

- Parser: 40 points 
- In this assignment, you will build an English treebank parser. You will consider both the problem of learning a grammar from a treebank and the problem of parsing with that grammar.
  The data is from the Penn Treebank, you can divide the data into the training data, the development data, and the blind test data as required.
- You are recommended to build an array-based CYK parser, but you are also free to build an agenda-driven PCFG parser.
